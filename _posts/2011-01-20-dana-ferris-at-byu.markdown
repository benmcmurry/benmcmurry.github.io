  content: 'I sure wish I could have been there. Are the sessions being recording
    for internet sharing? <br /><br />In any case, thanks for sharing your summary;
    keep them up. I especially like what Dana Ferris said about working with others:
    I want to improve my ability to cooperate with other departments to improve ESL
    support all over the university.'

  content: I also really liked what she said about assessment, and how it has to fit
    objectives for the course.  Non-traditional assessments can be the perfect fit
    for the objectives you are trying to meet.  It was a great lecture.

The Linguistics and English Language Department at BYU is sponsoring a lecture series on second language literacy. Today, Dana Ferris was the speaker. It was great to here her speak. She is a very intelligent person with a clear perception of the field. She provided some very helpful insights about teaching. She listed 10 things she feels are the most important in developing literacy.  
<!--more-->
1. Extensive reading
2. Vocabulary Development
3. Text Selection
4. Reading Strategies
5. Reading/Writing Assessment
6. Peer Response
7. Teacher Feedback
8. Grammar Instruction
9. Written Corrective Feedback
10. Collaboration Among Faculty

One of the things that I enjoyed about her was her attitude toward working with others. She said we don't need be prideful and that we don't need to have a chip on a shoulder. We should be willing to work with English departments and all departments to help ESL student write better. This really stuck out to me. We, as ESL professionals, don't know everything.  

She also brought up some things that teachers do that are "mean." She said that the high-stakes timed writing is mean. She said that when teachers wait to give feedback until the final draft is "mean." I agree.
