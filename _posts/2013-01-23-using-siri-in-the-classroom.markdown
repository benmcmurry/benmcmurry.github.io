This semester I have a deaf student in my class. He's fluent in Russian, Uzbek, American Sign Language, and Russian Sign Language. He's here to learn English. Communication with him involves an interpreter or a series of notes on paper.

Enter Siri. After class, his interpreter had to leave but he still needed to talk. Honestly, I got tired of writing/typing everything. It was slow and annoying. I opened up notes on my ipad mini and started using Siri. I could say whatever I wanted and it would be written in real time. He would then type his response. It sped up our communication and was fun for both of us. Siri, thanks for making my job easier and enjoyable!
