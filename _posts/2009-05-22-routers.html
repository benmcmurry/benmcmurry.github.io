<p>I use the Internet all the time. I had been noticing that my computer seemed slow. I have a mac and i had noticed that my wife's PCs were much faster on the web. After some searching, I found that I am not the only person with this problem. One suggestion was to change the DNS servers. So, I changed them to openDNS servers. That seemed to help a bit, but the other day my wife was using my machine and mentioned how much slower it was.<br/><br/>The investigation continued. I found that for some reason, some people think that macs don't like Linksys routers. I was looking for a solution and found an open source firmware update called DD-WTR. I used it to update my firmware, and I have found some added snappiness to my web travels. If you are technically talented and have a linksys router, this might be something worth trying.</p>
