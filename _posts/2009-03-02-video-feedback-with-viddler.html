<p>I've been taking a class for fun this semester. We've talked about Flash &amp; ActionScript, and now we are talking about JavaScript &amp; html. I was interested in developing a good and easy tool for my students to record video where I could give them feedback. When I was talking about the idea, <a href="http://education.byu.edu/ipt/php/faculty/displayfacultypage.php?userName=rich">Peter Rich</a>, a professor in the <a href="http://education.byu.edu/ipt/index.html">IP&amp;T</a> department here at <a href="http://www.byu.edu/">BYU</a>, suggested I look into <a href="http://viddler.com/">Viddler</a>. I did, and I love it.<br/><br/>For the last three weeks I have been using <a href="http://viddler.com/">Viddler</a> in my Listening &amp; Speaking classes. We went to our wonderful computer lab and I helped them all set up accounts. We made a group for the class and did some practice recordings. I have had them do three assignments so far.<br/><br/>Our current curriculum for Listening &amp; Speaking has task-based objectives. The assignments so far have been to record an invitation to a party, talk about your future plans and goals, and talk about a past experience. After the students have recorded their video, they give themselves feedback by annotating the video. Some of the students really do a good job, but I obviously need to do some student training. To be honest, I don't give the best feedback either right now. Giving feedback to 37 students can be taxing.<br/><br/>Overall, I am pleased with <a href="http://viddler.com/">viddler</a>. What do you use to give students feedback on speaking?</p>
