<p>Help me win! Watch this video:</p>
<p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=akEtBM7oR7g[/embed]</p>
<p>I am participating in a competition in Instructional Design at BYU. The first part of the competition was pitching our product to a panel of judges. My team won! For the second part, whichever design team gets the most people to watch their pitch video wins an ipad. Please watch our video. I get 10 points for every unique state or country that views it and 1 point per person. Please tell your friends to watch it too. The deadline for the competition is April 7, 2011 at 11:59pm.</p>
