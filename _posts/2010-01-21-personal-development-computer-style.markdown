Whoa! Two posts in one day! Hold on! As part of my own personal development, I'd like to blog more. It helps me share ideas.  

[Dragos Roua](http://www.dragosroua.com/) has an interesting [post](http://www.dragosroua.com/are-you-the-best-version-of-yourself/) on being your best self. It compares us to computers. I think that there are some good points here, especially the unexpected shutdown.  

Balance your core features  

Defrag your mind  

Update your drivers  

Stay virus free  

Enjoy an unexpected shutdown every now and then
