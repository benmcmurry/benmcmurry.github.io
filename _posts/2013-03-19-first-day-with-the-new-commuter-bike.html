<p>In case you were unaware, I sold my trike to buy a commuter bike . . . . and so far I love it! Today was the first day of commuting by bike. I have always wanted to be bike commuter, but the trike just wasn't doing it for me. It's so hard to store and hard to take places. Plus, it's an expensive piece of art that I couldn't just leave anywhere.</p>

<p>I added 15 minutes to my total commute time, but also added 40 minutes of moderate exercise. Many of you may thing that 20 minutes to go 4 miles is slow. There is a giant hill I have to overcome! Check out the elevation profile.</p>

<p>Long story short. I like cycling and I like cycling to work!</p>
