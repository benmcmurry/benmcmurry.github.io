<p>The last few days have been miserable, yet they have also been a pleasant change of pace. I've been busy . . . . super busy. Perhaps even the busiest I have ever been. From January 1st to April 1st, I was working 60 hour weeks. The hours were spread out (not evenly) between 3 jobs and working on a dissertation. On April 1st I quit my job. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5884700/job-quitters-are-the-happiest-people-around-and-how-to-deal-with-soulless-careerists" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quitters really are the happiest people.</a>&nbsp;I was subsequently brought on as a contractor/consultant for the company. I turned in my dissertation to my committee with a scheduled defense date of May 16th. So, what have I been doing? Three things really.</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>I was the sickest I have ever been in my adult life.</li>
<li>I've updated my <a href="http://benmcmurry.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">landing page</a> and <a href="http://portfolio.benmcmurry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolio</a>.</li>
<li>I finally went through and caught up on my RSS feeds and posted stuff to <a href="http://twitter.com/benmcmurry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">twitter</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/110466253529943196246/posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">google plus.</a></li>
</ol>
<div>This doesn't mean I'm not busy working. I've got plenty to do; it just doesn't take me 60 hours a week anymore.</div>
