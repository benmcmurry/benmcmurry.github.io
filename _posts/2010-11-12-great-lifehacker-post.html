<p>I have not been a great blogger lately. I can't believe that my last post was on May 31st.<br/><br/>This week I saw a great post on lifehacker.com. Lifehacker is an awesome blog with loads of posts about interesting tips about life. This week they had a post on some language tools. <a href="http://goo.gl/NFEW1">Click here to check them out</a>.<br/><br/>I had seen or used most of the tools, but the one I didn't know about was <a href="http://afterthedeadline.com/">After the Deadline</a>. So far, it seems to be quite good. It's a nifty tool that could probably best be described as the Super Hero version of Spelling/Grammar Checkers. Language teachers, especially writing teachers, might find it incredibly helpful. I hope to teach a class at the ELC next semester. If I do, and if it's writing, I might explore some of these things.</p>
