<p>Lastly, I would like to report on some findings I made with regard to Apple Devices and their supported video playback.<br/><br/>I did some tests with h.264 video encoding. A lot of this won't mean much, but it's nice to write it down for future reference.<br/><br />
<h4>Ipods do not support:</h4>
<p><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>b-frames</li>
<p><br/>
<li>cabac</li>
<p><br/>
<li>trellis</li>
<p><br/>
<li>8x8dct</li>
<p><br/></ul>
<p><br/><br />
<h4>Ipods Do support</h4>
<p><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Resolutions greater than what is listed on Apple's website provided that the height does not exceed the listed height (i.e. 640x480 is listed as the max for the iPod touch, but it will play 855x480.) Of course, it won't show a high resolution, it will down-convert it to what it can show.</span></strong></li>
<p><br/>
<li>4 reference frames</li>
<p><br/>
<li>detecelining</li>
<p><br/>
<li>decoming</li>
<p><br/></ul>
<p><br/>I also have to note that <a href="http://handbrake.fr/">handbrake's</a> presets are pretty good for apple devices.</p>
