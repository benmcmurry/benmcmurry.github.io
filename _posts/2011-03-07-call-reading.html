<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am in the thick of reading in preparation for the big "D" . . . and I don't mean Dallas (which would be fun). . . or divorce (which would be horrible). &nbsp;No, this "D" is somewhere in the middle and it stands for Dissertation. I plan on defending my prospectus soon. I've already started working on one of my articles. As I was hauling my books around the house this evening I thought I should take a picture so I could remember how much fun I am having&mdash;and I'm not being sarcastic. Some days are not fun, but for the most part I enjoy what I am doing.</p>
