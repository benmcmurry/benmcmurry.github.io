<p>I've heard great things about using ifttt.com. I finally got around to using it. It's a great way to automate repetitive tasks on the Internet. For example, you can make a recipe that automagically saves pictures from Pinterest to dropbox. I think I may have just made a recipe that will repost this blog on my professional blog to my family blog. If it works as well as it claims to, then I'll love it.</p>
<p>Here is a picture. I wanted to see how this works.</p>
<p>(It worked, but the picture has been removed.)</p>
