<p>I recently did a Poster Session at an Apple Education Conference: AcademiX. It was a lot of fun. I thought that I would share what what I did. For more information you can look at the&nbsp;<a href="http://benmcmurry.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/Poster-Session-AcademiX.pdf">Poster Session PDF</a>.</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>For starters, this is something that I did with my intermediate ESL students.&nbsp; In order to help them with them learn the past tense, I gave them an assignment.</p>
<p>The student videos were comprised of two parts. First, the students drew their story as if it were a comic. Second, the students narrated the story.</p>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>1. The students were divided into groups of four or five.<br />
2. Each group was assigned one of the four topics:<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frightening Experience - Fire<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frightening Experience - Car accident<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frightening Experience - Getting Lost<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Embarrassing Moment<br />
3. Each group brainstormed to find a good story to tell for their assigned topic.<br />
4. The students then began to take turns drawing pictures to go with their stories.<br />
5. While not drawing, the other students would review and practice their portion of the speaking part.</p>
<p>During this portion the students had great authentic language use.</p>
<p><strong>Brainstorming </strong>- The students told personal stories about their past while thinking of good topics. The students negotiated ideas as they decided on a story whether fictional or real.<br />
<strong>Practicing</strong> - The students were able to use more language as they practiced their presentation. They helped one another and corrected each other.</p>
<p>I should note that this was done over the course of a week. For each class period, they were given 30 minutes to work on the project.</p>
<p>Day 1 - Brainstorming<br />
Day 2 - Creating a Story<br />
Day 3 - Drawing the Pictures<br />
Day 4 - Recording their stories</p>
<h4>Putting it all together</h4>
<p>1. The students pictures were scanned and imported into iPhoto where they were edited.<br />
2. Students recorded their dialogs using GarageBand, Sound Studio or WireTap Studio Pro. The students used iMacs with their built in microphones.<br />
3. The audio and pictures were imported into iMovie where it was all put together.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>It was a fun activity for everyone. It did put a lot of the burden on me to put it all together, but it was worth it.</p>
