<p>I've been working at the Center for Teaching and Learning for a little over a month now. I only go in for 1-2 hours a day. I'm working on some exciting projects. The one I am enjoying most though is the construction of some type of learning taxonomy for affective aspects of education. Bloom's taxonomy was a great start. The cognitive domain has been built upon, improved, and used since its inception. The Psychomotor domain is used quite a bit in performance areas. The affective domain is the neglected child. I've been working with Richard Swan. I've been finding categories to include in this taxonomy. So far, we have Empathy, Moral Reasoning, Integrity, Discipline, Humility, Charity, Drive and&nbsp;Aesthetic&nbsp;Ability. I'll post more as it begins to fill out, but I think this is off to a great start.</p>
