<p>I really enjoyed TESOL this year. I won't talk about the things I didn't particulary like about the conference organization. I think that there were some problems that could have been devastating to my experience. I complained a lot about then, but I made sure I would have an awesome time at TESOL.<br/><br/><em>How did I do it?</em> Well, that's a good question. I took a different approach to TESOL this year.<br/><br/><strong>Previous Approach:</strong> I wanted to get the biggest bang for my Institution's Buck. I made sure that I went to all the sessions I possibly could. For example, even if I couldn't find something I like during the 10am sessions, I would pick the one that seemed the least painful to go to and go to it. This made for a long day filled with unproductive sessions.<br/><br/><strong>New Approach: </strong>This year, I only went to sessions I really wanted to go to. I probably went to half as many sessions, but I found it to be much more beneficial. I didn't go to as many sessions, but I felt like I learned just as much.<br/><br/><em>How was this more productive?</em><br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>I was more alert and enthusiastic about the sessions I actually went to.</li>
<p><br/>
<li>I found some interesting thing to do when I wasn't in a session.</li>
<p><br/></ol>
<p><br/><em>What did I do?</em><br/><br/>I really enjoyed the electronic village. They have presentations, but they are smaller and more hands on. At first I thought that I wouldn't learn anything, but actually I learned a lot. These activities combined with interviews with possible employers, networking, and quality discussions with publishers, I really filled the gap. This was a great conference!<br/><br/>Check back later for more details!</p>
