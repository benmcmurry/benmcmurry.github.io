I recently did a Poster Session at an Apple Education Conference: AcademiX. It was a lot of fun. I thought that I would share what what I did. For more information you can look at the [Poster Session PDF](/uploads/2009/04/Poster-Session-AcademiX.pdf).

#### Overview

For starters, this is something that I did with my intermediate ESL students.  In order to help them with them learn the past tense, I gave them an assignment.

The student videos were comprised of two parts. First, the students drew their story as if it were a comic. Second, the students narrated the story.

#### Preparation

1\. The students were divided into groups of four or five.  
2\. Each group was assigned one of the four topics:  
•    Frightening Experience - Fire  
•    Frightening Experience - Car accident  
•    Frightening Experience - Getting Lost  
•    Most Embarrassing Moment  
3\. Each group brainstormed to find a good story to tell for their assigned topic.  
4\. The students then began to take turns drawing pictures to go with their stories.  
5\. While not drawing, the other students would review and practice their portion of the speaking part.

During this portion the students had great authentic language use.

**Brainstorming** - The students told personal stories about their past while thinking of good topics. The students negotiated ideas as they decided on a story whether fictional or real.  
**Practicing** - The students were able to use more language as they practiced their presentation. They helped one another and corrected each other.

I should note that this was done over the course of a week. For each class period, they were given 30 minutes to work on the project.

Day 1 - Brainstorming  
Day 2 - Creating a Story  
Day 3 - Drawing the Pictures  
Day 4 - Recording their stories

#### Putting it all together

1\. The students pictures were scanned and imported into iPhoto where they were edited.  
2\. Students recorded their dialogs using GarageBand, Sound Studio or WireTap Studio Pro. The students used iMacs with their built in microphones.  
3\. The audio and pictures were imported into iMovie where it was all put together.

#### Conclusion

It was a fun activity for everyone. It did put a lot of the burden on me to put it all together, but it was worth it.
