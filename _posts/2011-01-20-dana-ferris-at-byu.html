  content: 'I sure wish I could have been there. Are the sessions being recording
    for internet sharing? <br /><br />In any case, thanks for sharing your summary;
    keep them up. I especially like what Dana Ferris said about working with others:
    I want to improve my ability to cooperate with other departments to improve ESL
    support all over the university.'

  content: I also really liked what she said about assessment, and how it has to fit
    objectives for the course.  Non-traditional assessments can be the perfect fit
    for the objectives you are trying to meet.  It was a great lecture.

<p>The Linguistics and English Language Department at BYU is sponsoring a lecture series on second language literacy. Today, Dana Ferris was the speaker. It was great to here her speak. She is a very intelligent person with a clear perception of the field. She provided some very helpful insights about teaching. She listed 10 things she feels are the most important in developing literacy.<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Extensive reading</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Vocabulary Development</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Text Selection</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Reading Strategies</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Reading/Writing Assessment</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Peer Response</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Teacher Feedback</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Grammar Instruction</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Written Corrective Feedback</li>
<p><br/>
<li>Collaboration Among Faculty</li>
<p><br/></ol>
<p><br/>One of the things that I enjoyed about her was her attitude toward working with others. She said we don't need be prideful and that we don't need to have a chip on a shoulder. We should be willing to work with English departments and all departments to help ESL student write better. This really stuck out to me. We, as ESL professionals, don't know everything.<br/><br/>She also brought up some things that teachers do that are "mean." She said that the high-stakes timed writing is mean. She said that when teachers wait to give feedback until the final draft is "mean." I agree.</p>
