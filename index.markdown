### I'm a teacher, learner, linguist, evaluator, administrator, and instructional designer.

Currently, I'm working as the Program Coordinator for [Brigham Young University's](https://www.byu.edu) Intensive English Program-- the [English Language Center](https://elc.byu.edu) . I'm passionate about teacher training, curriculum and materials development, and program evaluation. I enjoy qualitative research and anything that helps me better understand language learning and teaching.Feel free to checkout my profile on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O8AfAxMAAAAJ&hl=en) or [Academia.edu.](https://byu.academia.edu/BenjaminMcMurry)

You can also check out what's left of my [blog.](https://benmcmurry.github.io) It's going through a transition, though.

Outside of my professional work, I love music, walking, cycling, and all things technology. My favorite role is that of husband and father.
